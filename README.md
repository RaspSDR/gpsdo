BOM Changes
1. Cell G34 has "LT1963AEQ-1.8#PBF" corrected to LT1963A-adj.
2. Cell C28 has "EC11B15242B1" specified, which has been discontinued and replaced with EC11B15242AE.
Add C6 capacitor silk screen to PCB
Added iBOM, which allows you to directly view the original part location by opening it through a browser "InteractiveBOM_gpsdo-phil_2025-9-10.html"
The PCB can use a shell with the specification of "aluminum alloy shell 71*25*100", which can be obtained from JLC or found from other places.

Re-upload the new source code, GPSDO_V1.0_20250823.zip is the latest



Features
User Experience: Simple and ease of use UI with a small LCD screen and an encoder.
TCXO Output: A stable reference clock available as either a square wave or a sine wave.
Si5351 Output: Generated by the Si5351 clock generator. The Si5351 frequency can be set anywhere from 8 kHz to 160 MHz in 1 Hz increments.

For ease of production, we have redesigned the PCB. The PCB can be produced by PCB manufacturers such as JLCPCB. The gerber and schematic files can be obtained in the catalog.

By the way, there are a few good open-source projects on the rx-888 website. It also includes open-source information for gpsdo.
