GPSDO with Pico
Noteï¼šThis work is mainly done by Phil Harman (VK6PH). Appreciate him to grant us the permission to release this work to public

Features
User Experience: Simple and ease of use UI with a small LCD screen and an encoder.
TCXO Output: A stable reference clock available as either a square wave or a sine wave.
Si5351 Output: Generated by the Si5351 clock generator. The Si5351 frequency can be set anywhere from 8 kHz to 160 MHz in 1 Hz increments.

For ease of production, we have redesigned the PCB. The PCB can be produced by PCB manufacturers such as JLCPCB. The gerber and schematic files can be obtained in the catalog.
